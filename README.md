# yat-seed

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)-[AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org)-[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) seed project.

This base project is based on the Yeoman AngularJS generator with the following modifications:
 * Added Twitter Bootstrap
 * Changed the Chrome Frame prompt to appear on IE 7 (as AngularJS does not work out of the box with IE 7)
